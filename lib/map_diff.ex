defmodule MapDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  Calculates the difference between two (nested) maps.

  The idea is very simple:
  One of four things can happen to each key in a map:

  - It remains the same: `:equal`
  - It was not in the original map, but it is in the new one: `:added`
  - It was in the original map, but is no longer in the new one: `:removed`
  - It is in both maps, but its value changed.

  For the fourth variant, MapDiff.diff/2 returns `:primitive_change`
  if the value under the key was 'simply changed',
  and `:map_change` if in both arguments this value itself is a map,
  which means that `MapDiff.diff/2` was called on it recursively.

  """

  @doc """
  This is the single function that MapDiff currently exports.

  It returns a 'patch', which is a map describing the changes between
  `map_a` and `map_b`.

  ## Examples

  If the (nested) map is still the same, it is considered `:equal`:

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{my: 1}, %{my: 1})
  %{changed: :equal, value: %{my: 1}}

  ```

  When a key disappears, it is considered `:removed`:

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{a: 1}, %{})
  %{added: %{}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{a: 1},
    value: %{a: %{changed: :removed, value: 1}}}

  ```

  When a key appears, it is considered `:added`:

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{}, %{b: 2})
  %{added: %{b: 2}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{},
    value: %{b: %{changed: :added, value: 2}}}

  ```

  When the value of a key changes (and the old nor the new value was a map),
  then this is considered a `:primitive_change`.

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{b: 3}, %{b: 2})
  %{added: %{b: 2}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{b: 3},
  value: %{b: %{added: 2, changed: :primitive_change, removed: 3}}}

  ```

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{val: 3}, %{val: %{}})
  %{added: %{val: %{}}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{val: 3},
  value: %{val: %{added: %{}, changed: :primitive_change,
  removed: 3}}}

  ```

  When the value of a key changes, and the old and new values are both maps,
    then this is considered a `:map_change` that can be parsed recursively.

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%{a: %{}}, %{a: %{b: 1}})
  %{added: %{a: %{b: 1}}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{a: %{}},
  value: %{a: %{added: %{b: 1}, changed: :map_change, removed: %{},
  value: %{b: %{changed: :added, value: 1}}}}}

  ```

  A more complex example, to see what happens with nested maps:

  ```elixir
  iex> foo = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: %{d: 3, e: 4, f: 5}}
  iex> bar = %{a: 1, b: 42, c: %{d: %{something_else: "entirely"}, f: 10}}
  iex> MapDiff.diff(foo, bar)
  %{added: %{a: 1, b: 42,
  c: %{d: %{something_else: "entirely"}, f: 10}},
  changed: :map_change,
  removed: %{a: 1, b: 2, c: %{d: 3, e: 4, f: 5}},
  value: %{a: %{changed: :equal, value: 1},
  b: %{added: 42, changed: :primitive_change, removed: 2},
  c: %{added: %{d: %{something_else: "entirely"}, f: 10},
  changed: :map_change, removed: %{d: 3, e: 4, f: 5},
  value: %{d: %{added: %{something_else: "entirely"},
  changed: :primitive_change, removed: 3},
  e: %{changed: :removed, value: 4},
  f: %{added: 10, changed: :primitive_change, removed: 5}}}}}


  ```

  It is also possible to compare two structs of the same kind.
  `MapDiff.diff/2` will add a `struct_name` field to the output,
  so you are reminded of the kind of struct whose fields were changed.


  For example, suppose you define the following structs:


  ```elixir
  defmodule Foo do
    defstruct a: 1, b: 2, c: 3
  end

  defmodule Bar do
    defstruct a: "foo", b: "bar", z: "baz"
  end

  ```

  Then the fields of one `Foo` struct can be compared to another:

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%Foo{}, %Foo{a: 3})
  %{added: %MapDiffTest.Foo{a: 3, b: 2, c: 3}, changed: :map_change,
  removed: %MapDiffTest.Foo{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3},
  struct_name: MapDiffTest.Foo,
  value: %{a: %{added: 3, changed: :primitive_change, removed: 1},
  b: %{changed: :equal, value: 2},
  c: %{changed: :equal, value: 3}}}

  ```

  When comparing two different kinds of structs, this of course
  results in a :primitive_change, as they are simply considered
  primitive data types.

  ```elixir
  iex> MapDiff.diff(%Foo{}, %Bar{})
  %{added: %Bar{a: "foo", b: "bar", z: "baz"}, changed: :primitive_change,
    removed: %Foo{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}}

  ```
